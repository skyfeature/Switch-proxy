# Switch-proxy
Switch system proxy on network change in Unix based system. Execute the file auto_proxy on network change. 
If your work or school or college uses proxy based internet access but at home you use no proxy, this is the right place to come.
Download auto_proxy and modify it based on your requirements like proxy and port settings. Also don't forget to change the network name as it appears in network utility.
